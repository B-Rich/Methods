This is my "miscellaneous stuff I want to link to that's too small for its own repository" repository.

Individual bits can be found in their own subfolder. For example, all the things related to the constant-time immutable queue is under Methods/Types/ConstantTimeImmutableQueue (and the corresponding tests are at MethodsTest/Types/ConstantTimeImmutableQueue).

I, Craig Gidney, wrote all of the code in this repository.
All of the code in this repository can be used freely and without restriction.

More specifically, that means:
- Attribution not required.
- Commercial use allowed.
- Derivative use allowed.
- Relicensing allowed.

But note:
- No guarantees (I did my best to ensure correctness, but I am not infallible.).

Not that I wouldn't mind hearing about it if you used my code...
If you need a 'real' license for obtuse legal reasons, I would be happy to grant it.
